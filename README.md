# Quest Log

## Description
Are you a chosen hero whose legendary exploits are too epic for a mundane to-do list? You might be interested in perusing my latest project: Quest Log – a fun twist on task management that adds a spirit of adventure to getting things done!

Quest Log is a dynamic web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lets you:

## Features
- **Add & Track Quests:** Add your quests in the provided input field – the app will render them as quests in title case.
- **Bookmark Important Quests:** Click the bookmark icon to indicate an important quest – the app will automatically move it to the top of the list and provide additional styling.
- **Set Deadlines:** Set optional deadlines to stay on top of time-sensitive tasks. A clock icon indicates a task with a deadline, and the title of the quest will turn red when a deadline is an hour or less away.
- **Add Unique Details:** Each quest is an instance of an object, which means that you can add unique details and deadlines across each one. Add meeting details to one quest while another contains a shopping list – it’s up to you
- **Save and Load:** Quest Log saves your input in your browser locally. Refresh the page or close your browser – your quests will still be there!
